# Privacy Preserving RFC

Privacy Preserving RFC builds and tests a machine learning model that uses differntial privacy and inspiration from the PATE model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08908) to make predictions about network traffic data, while preserving data privacy. The implementation uses Scikit-Learn's Random Forest Classifier and tests various configured models to find which model consistently makes predictions with the highest accuracy.

# Research

I wrote the first draft of an academic research paper with intention to continue future drafts/editing and submit to machine learning conferences for publishing. The paper documents the project purpose, details, and results.
